I am a bioinformatician trained with an emphasis on the interconnection of wet
lab researchers and computational researchers. My academic and research training
included eukaryotic biology, genome research, and wet lab training in addition
to comprehensive training in theoretical and applied bioinformatics to allow the
fluent communication between wet lab and bioinformatics. My work has focused on
the analysis of genomics and transcriptomics data in order to answer questions
in industrial biotechnology, ageing, and, since 2015, cardiovascular research.

I am currently working as postdoctoral researcher at the University Hospital
Heidelberg in the [Section of Bioinformatics and Systems Cardiology (Dieterich
lab)](https://dieterichlab.org). My primary research topic are [circular
RNAs](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S167202291630033X) (circRNAs)
in the context of cardiovascular disease. As a bioinformatician, I am working
on solutions for the [detection](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/DCC) and
[analysis](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/circtools) of circRNAs from
sequencing data in order to obtain a [deeper understanding of their
function](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/circtools).

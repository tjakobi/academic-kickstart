abstract: "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) originate through back-splicing events from linear primary transcripts, are resistant to exonucleases, are not polyadenylated, and have been shown to be highly specific for cell type and developmental stage. CircRNA detection starts from high-throughput sequencing data and is a multi-stage bioinformatics process yielding sets of potential circRNA candidates that require further analyses. While a number of tools for the prediction process already exist, publicly available analysis tools for further characterization are rare. Our work provides researchers with a harmonized workflow that covers different stages of in silico circRNA analyses, from prediction to first functional insights."
